\section{Problem Description}
Automatic Scene Recognition(ASR) is a problem of automatically recognize the environmental scene where an audio clip is recorded. Usually audio recorded in a specific scene contains some special sound for that environment, like car honk in street, showering in bathroom, etc. The problem we studied here is to recognize the scenes using audio clips [\cite{IEEE-1363}].   

\section{Approach}
Since our method is to recogize scenes by the events detected in clips, our project basically involved two parts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Audio event detection}
\item{Scene inference by events}
\end{itemize}
Firstly, for the event detection problem, we build Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) to train on features extracted from audios. Then we segment the audio into parts and assume each part contain one event. Event detection is performed on every segments using the models we trained.\\
Secondly, once we have detected the events from a clip, we get a event sequence describing the testing clips. 

\section{Possible Usage}
Recognizing the scene behind a recorded audio clips could help we to further processing audios. We can do audio tagging. Moreover, with the spread of mobile phones, we can also use this technique in phones to help it automatically detect the envrioment around it.
