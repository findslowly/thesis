\section{Audio Data}
The audio data for the events we chosed is downloaded from Sound Search Engine (SSE). 
There are many available SSEs for crawling sound clips, e.g., SoundJax \footnote{http://soundjax.com}, FindSounds \footnote{http://findsounds.com}, and Freesound\footnote{http://freesound.org}. 
We use all these SSEs to query the audio events and then download their corresponding clips. 
However, this downloading process is carried out with some filtering technique. 
Because the events we are considering suitable are "primitive" constituents for large audio context, their information should be covered in a comparative short time. 
So we set up a duration threshold for candidate audio clips, i.e., only downloading clips in 0.5 to 10 seconds.  

Finally, we have downloaded !!! clips for !!! events. On average, !!!
